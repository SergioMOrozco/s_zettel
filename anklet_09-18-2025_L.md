# (L) Zero To One

- P10. Startups need a team to operate , but small enough so it can succeed. A lone genious nor a bureaucracy are capable of building different futures.
- P12. Conventional beliefs only appear wrong in retrospect
- P14. It could be the case that AI is in a bubble, but we can't be sure unless it fails.
- P17. We can draw parallels with OpenAI here. What will Peter suggest?
- P20. Isn't bullet 3, 1 to N thinking? Which is Peter against?
- P21. Yes to the above.
- P22. The dot com mania was peak clarity. People looked far into the future, and felt capable fo shaping it.
- P24. Perfect comeptition: every firm in a competitive market is undifferentiated and sells the same homogenous product, like airplane companies.
- P25. Monopolies innovate their way to the top such that they don't need to share the market.
- P27. Monopolies like to lie. They don't want to be perceived as such and try to change perspective.
- P30. Non-monopolists try to differentiate themselves by being the intersection of many things. 
- P30. Monopoliests diguise themselves as the union of many things.
- P32. A monopoly can afford to think about a longterm future. non-monopolies (restaurants, etc) cannot.
- P33. Dynamic monopolies drive progress and replace the incumbent. How do I topple the current monopoly?
- P35. A failed company is a company that fails to escape the competition with innovation.
- P35. Peter argues that with more competition, the less we gain and descends into a personal anecdote that doesn't necessarily drive the point home. How can I succeed without competition? Create of league of my own?

- P40. winning is better than losing, but everybody loses when the war isn't worth fighting for.
